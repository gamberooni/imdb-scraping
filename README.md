7. do transformation on these json files and dump them into the postgres db
8. create a simple dashboard to show top 5 sorted by some criteria

11. airflow(scraping job + transformation here) - minio - postgres - superset/redash?

## Starting Docker containers
1. Create docker network
```
$ docker network create -d bridge imdb-scraping
```
2. Create `minio` and `postgres` containers
```
$ docker-compose up -d
```
3. Create directories for `airflow` 
```
$ sudo mkdir -p airflow/dags airflow/plugins airflow/logs
$ sudo chmod -R 777 airflow
```
4. Run database migrations and create the first user account for `airflow`
```
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-airflow.yaml up airflow-init
```
5. Start all `airflow` containers
```
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-airflow.yaml up -d
```
6. Visit `localhost:8080` and login with 
```
username: airflow
password: airflow
```
